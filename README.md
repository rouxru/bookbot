# Bookbot

# Description:

BookBot is my first self-driven git project!

It is a script which generates a report based on a given book

# To Run:
Create a folder called books
create a text file called "frankenstein.txt"
Copy and paste the Frankenstein book into the text file from here - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asweigart/codebreaker/master/frankenstein.txt

Once done, execute the script to see the generated report

Substitute the book path in the main function if your book is located elswhere or you want to try different books
