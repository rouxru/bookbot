# Bookbot

## Description:

BookBot is my first self-driven git project!

It is a script which generates a report based on a given book

## To Run:
* Create a folder called "books"

* create a text file called "frankenstein.txt"

* Copy and paste the Frankenstein book into the text file from below:
**https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asweigart/codebreaker/master/frankenstein.txt**

Once done, execute the script to see the generated report

Substitute the book path in the main function if your book is located elswhere or you want to try different books
